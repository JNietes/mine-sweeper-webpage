# Minesweeper with a web GUI!

The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of Javascript, DOM, HTML, and CSS.

To impliment features from Minesweeper, I used functions to manipulate tile objects that represent each square on the board. All of the tile objects are stored in a single dimension array, so I used the power of the modulus operator to make the board act like it is two dimensional. An array of relative distances was vital to getting the information of adjacent tiles.
